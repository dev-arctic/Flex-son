                <article>The word Arctic comes from the Greek word ἀρκτικός (arktikos), "near the Bear, northern"[4] and
                    from the word ἄρκτος (arktos), meaning bear.[5] The name refers either to the constellation Ursa
                    Major, the "Great Bear", which is prominent in the northern portion of the celestial sphere, or to
                    the constellation Ursa Minor, the "Little Bear", which contains the celestial north pole (currently
                    very near Polaris, the current north Pole Star, or North Star).[6]

                    There are a number of definitions of what area is contained within the Arctic. The area can be
                    defined as north of the Arctic Circle (about 66° 34'N), the approximate southern limit of the
                    midnight sun and the polar night. Another definition of the Arctic, which is popular with
                    ecologists, is the region in the Northern Hemisphere where the average temperature for the warmest
                    month (July) is below 10 °C (50 °F); the northernmost tree line roughly follows the isotherm at the
                    boundary of this region<br><br> - Created By Admim</article>

                <article>The Arctic is characterized by cold winters and cool summers. Its precipitation mostly comes in
                    the form of snow and is low, with most of the area receiving less than 50 cm (20 in). High winds
                    often stir up snow, creating the illusion of continuous snowfall. Average winter temperatures can go
                    as low as −40 °C (−40 °F), and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately −68 °C (−90 °F).
                    Coastal Arctic climates are moderated by oceanic influences, having generally warmer temperatures
                    and heavier snowfalls than the colder and drier interior areas. The Arctic is affected by current
                    global warming, leading to Arctic sea ice shrinkage, diminished ice in the Greenland ice sheet, and
                    Arctic methane release as the permafrost thaws.[9] The melting of Greenland's ice sheet is linked to
                    polar amplification.[10]
                    <br><br>
                    Due to the poleward migration of the planet's isotherms (about 56 km (35 mi) per decade during the
                    past 30 years as a consequence of global warming), the Arctic region (as defined by tree line and
                    temperature) is currently shrinking.[11] Perhaps the most alarming result of this is Arctic sea ice
                    shrinkage. There is a large variance in predictions of Arctic sea ice loss, with models showing
                    near-complete to complete loss in September from 2035 to some time around 2067.[12][13]<br><br> - Created By

                <article>The Arctic (/ˈɑːrtɪk/ or /ˈɑːrktɪk/)[1][Note 1] is a polar region located at the northernmost part of Earth. The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean, adjacent seas, and parts of Canada (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut), Danish Realm (Greenland), northern Finland (Lapland), Iceland, northern Norway (Finnmark and Svalbard), Russia (Murmansk, Siberia, Nenets Okrug, Novaya Zemlya), northernmost Sweden and the United States (Alaska). Land within the Arctic region has seasonally varying snow and ice cover, with predominantly treeless permafrost (permanently frozen underground ice) containing tundra. Arctic seas contain seasonal sea ice in many places.
                    <br><br>
                    The Arctic region is a unique area among Earth's ecosystems. The cultures in the region and the Arctic indigenous peoples have adapted to its cold and extreme conditions. Life in the Arctic includes zooplankton and phytoplankton, fish and marine mammals, birds, land animals, plants and human societies.[3] Arctic land is bordered by the subarctic.

                <article>Main article: Territorial claims in the Arctic
                    No country owns the geographic North Pole or the region of the Arctic Ocean surrounding it. The surrounding six Arctic states that border the Arctic Ocean—Canada, Kingdom of Denmark (with Greenland), Iceland, Norway, Russia, and the United States—are limited to a 200 nautical miles (370 km; 230 mi) exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off their coasts. Two Arctic states (Finland and Sweden) do not have direct access to the Arctic Ocean.
                    
                    Upon ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a country has ten years to make claims to an extended continental shelf beyond its 200 nautical mile zone.[22][27] Due to this, Norway (which ratified the convention in 1996),[28] Russia (ratified in 1997),[28] Canada (ratified in 2003)[28] and the Kingdom of Denmark (ratified in 2004)[28] launched projects to establish claims that certain sectors of the Arctic seabed should belong to their territories.
                    <br><br>
                    On 2 August 2007, two Russian bathyscaphes, MIR-1 and MIR-2, for the first time in history descended to the Arctic seabed beneath the North Pole and placed there a Russian flag made of rust-proof titanium alloy. The flag-placing during Arktika 2007 generated commentary on and concern for a race for control of the Arctic's vast hydrocarbon resources.[29]

                    Foreign ministers and other officials representing Canada, the Kingdom of Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the United States met in Ilulissat, Greenland on 28 May 2008 at the Arctic Ocean Conference and announced the Ilulissat Declaration,[30][31] blocking any "new comprehensive international legal regime to govern the Arctic Ocean," and pledging "the orderly settlement of any possible overlapping claims."[22][32]
                    <br><br>
                    
                    As of 2012, the Kingdom of Denmark is claiming the continental shelf based on the Lomonosov Ridge between Greenland and over the North Pole to the northern limit of the Russian EEZ.[33]
                    <br><br>
                    
                    The Russian Federation is also claiming a large swath of seabed along the Lomonosov Ridge but, unlike Denmark, confined its claim to its side of the Arctic. In August 2015, Russia made a supplementary submission for the expansion of the external borders of its continental shelf in the Arctic Ocean, asserting that the eastern part of the Lomonosov Ridge and the Mendeleyev Ridge are an extension of the Eurasian continent. In August 2016, the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf began to consider Russia's submission.[34]
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Canada claims the Northwest Passage as part of its internal waters belonging to Canada, while the United States and most maritime nations[35] regards it as an international strait, which means that foreign vessels have right of transit passage.[36]

                <article>The eight Arctic nations (Canada, Kingdom of Denmark [Greenland & The Faroe Islands], Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia, and USA) are all members of the Arctic Council, as are organizations representing six indigenous populations. The council operates on consensus basis, mostly dealing with environmental treaties and not addressing boundary or resource disputes.
                    <br><br>
                    Though Arctic policy priorities differ, every Arctic nation is concerned about sovereignty/defense, resource development, shipping routes, and environmental protection.[22] Much work remains on regulatory agreements regarding shipping, tourism, and resource development in Arctic waters.[23] Arctic shipping is subject to some regulatory control through the International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters, adopted by the International Maritime Organization on 1 January 2017 and applies to all ships in Arctic waters over 500 tonnes.[24][25]
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Research in the Arctic has long been a collaborative international effort, evidenced by the International Polar Year. The International Arctic Science Committee, hundreds of scientists and specialists of the Arctic Council, and the Barents Euro-Arctic Council are more examples of collaborative international Arctic research.[26] <br><br> - Created By Arctic Mentor</article>
